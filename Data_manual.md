# PokeTools Data Manual (Simple)

This short guide explains the **three kinds of data** you’ll see in this repo:

1) **Raw data** (cached PokéAPI payloads)
2) **Derived data** (clean, normalized models)
3) **Export data** (the final Excel workbook)

It’s written for humans who just want to understand “what is this file?” without reading the specs.

## 1) Raw data (`data/raw/**`)

**What it is:** raw JSON responses downloaded from **PokéAPI** (the public Pokémon data API).

- Source: https://pokeapi.co/
- Each file contains the API payload wrapped with a small `_meta` block (fetch time, URL, etc.).
- This is the “source material” for everything else in the pipeline.

**Where it lives:**
- `data/raw/pokemon/<form_key>.json` (form-level)
- `data/raw/species/<species_id>.json` (species-level)
- `data/raw/move/<move_key>.json`, `data/raw/item/<item_key>.json`, etc.

**How to think about it:**
- Raw data is **not cleaned** and is not meant to be pleasant to read.
- Raw data is **immutable**: don’t edit it by hand.
- If something looks odd in derived/export, raw is where you check first.

## 2) Derived data (`data/derived/**`)

**What it is:** normalized, deterministic JSON generated by the Transform stage.

Derived data is intentionally **simpler than the raw API**:
- fewer nested objects
- stable keys
- consistent ordering
- null-safe (missing optional fields become `null` instead of crashing)

**Why it exists:**
- Raw PokéAPI payloads are great for “full fidelity”, but not great for Excel.
- Derived models are the project’s “domain models” used by export.

**Examples (high level):**
- `pokemon_forms.json`: one record per Pokémon form (what becomes one row in the Pokémon sheet)
- `learnset_entries.json`: detailed learn records (form + version_group + move + method + level)
- `moves.json`, `items.json`, `abilities.json`, `natures.json`
- `evolution_edges.json`: flattened evolution relationships
- `type_chart.json`: type effectiveness data
- `meta.json`: reproducibility metadata (generated time, config context)

**Important:** derived data is still **data**, not “presentation”. Export should not change it.

## 3) Export data (`data/export/**`)

**What it is:** the final, Excel-friendly output.

- Main output: `data/export/pokedata.xlsx`
- This workbook is generated from derived JSON only.

**What’s inside:**
- Separate sheets for Pokémon, Learnsets, Moves, Items, Abilities, Natures, Evolutions, TypeChart, and Meta.
- Rows and columns are written in a deterministic order so reruns are stable.

**How to use it:**
- Open `data/export/pokedata.xlsx` in Excel.
- Use it as the dataset for analysis, lookups, tools, or as input to other workflows.
